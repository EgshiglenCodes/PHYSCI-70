									After scrolling through many images of various Buddhist gods and idols, I picked one image to use as a reference for my model.
									I cleaned up the image in Photoshop and then exported the .png to Fusion360 to use as a reference as I drew out the sketch of the main body.
								</p>
							<h5> The Sketch </h5>
								<img class="fit" src="images/week2/sketch.png" alt="Sketch">
								<p>
									Before I proceeded with creating the various parts of the press-fit construction, I sketched out the ways I would transfer a 2D image
									to a freestanding 3D construction. I was concerned with how I would ensure the model would stay upright and how I would connect the arms to main body.
									For simplicity, I decided I would create cross-hair feet to keep the model upright and create a 'spine' running behind the model to attach the arms.
								</p>
								<img class="fit" src="images/week2/fusion.png" alt="Fusion">
								<p>
									Actually sketching the press-fit shapes in Fusion3D was the most time intensive step of the process, but only because the design is mainly non-linear
									shapes. I made simplifications on smaller details for time. The final Fusion3D sketch included designs for the front-facing torso, arm, spine, and feet.
									The shape for the arms were replicated later in Lightburn.
								</br>
								</br>
									The width of 'notches' that would be used to press the shapes together depends on the thickness of the stock and the laser kerf. I wanted a tight fit between my
									pieces so I standardized my notch widths to 4.2mm.  
								</p>
							<h5> The Cut & Assembly </h5>
								<img class="fit" src="images/week2/cut.gif" alt="Lasercut">
								<p>
									The design was cut onto 4.5mm cardboard stock. I used the recommended laser setting which was 15mm/s speed and 60% strength, which cut clean through the cardboard.
								</p>
								<img class="fit" src="images/week2/views.png" alt="Views">
								<p>
									As shown above, the model can be constructed to customize the direction of the arms and torso. The 4 unattached arms can be fitted facing up or down, and the
									torso can lean left or right depending on how the pieces are assembled.
								</p>
							<h5> The Final Product </h5>
								<img class="fit" src="images/week2/final.png" alt="Final">
								<p>
									I am very happy with the final result. My small press-fit idol now sits happily on my windowsill to bless all my future fabrication endevours.
