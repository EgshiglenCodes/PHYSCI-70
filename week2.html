                            <h5> The Inspiration </h5>
                                <img class="fit" src="images/week2/inspo.png" alt="Inspo">
                                <p>
                                    This week, I went out to eat at a Tibetan restaurant, where they had a beautiful tapestry depicting a Buddhist god with many arms.
                                    Knowing that for this week's assignment, I had to create a press-fit construction kit that can be assembled in multiple ways, I thought
                                    the many arms would make for a beautiful design.
                                </p>
                                <img class="fit" src="images/week2/process.png" alt="Process">
                                <p>
                                    After scrolling through many images of various Buddhist gods and idols, I picked one image to use as a reference for my model.
                                    I cleaned up the image in Photoshop and then exported the .png to Fusion360 to use as a reference as I drew out the sketch of the main body.
                                </p>
                            <h5> The Sketch </h5>
                                <img class="fit" src="images/week2/sketch.png" alt="Sketch">
                                <p>
                                    Before I proceeded with creating the various parts of the press-fit construction, I sketched out the ways I would transfer a 2D image
                                    to a freestanding 3D construction. I was concerned with how I would ensure the model would stay upright and how I would connect the arms to main body.
                                    For simplicity, I decided I would create cross-hair feet to keep the model upright and create a 'spine' running behind the model to attach the arms.
                                </p>
                                <img class="fit" src="images/week2/fusion.png" alt="Fusion">
                                <p>
                                    Actually sketching the press-fit shapes in Fusion3D was the most time intensive step of the process, but only because the design is mainly non-linear
                                    shapes. I made simplifications on smaller details for time. The final Fusion3D sketch included designs for the front-facing torso, arm, spine, and feet.
                                    The shape for the arms were replicated later in Lightburn.

                                </br>
                                    The width of 'notches' that would be used to press the shapes together depends on the thickness of the stock and the laser kerf. I wanted a tight fit between my
                                    pieces so I standardized my notch widths to 4.2mm.  
                                </p>
                            <h5> The Cut & Assembly </h5>
                                <img class="fit" src="images/week2/cut.gif" alt="Lasercut">
                                <p>
                                    The design was cut onto 4.5mm cardboard stock. I used the recommended laser setting which was 15mm/s speed and 60% strength, which cut clean through the cardboard.
                                </p>

                                    As shown above, the model can be constructed to customize the direction of the arms and torso. The 4 unattached arms can be fitted facing up or down, and the
                                    torso can lean left or right depending on how the pieces are assembled.
                                </p>
                            <h5> The Final Product </h5>
                                <img class="fit" src="images/week2/final.png" alt="Final">
                                <p>
                                    I am very happy with the final result. My small press-fit idol now sits happily on my windowsill to bless all my future fabrication endevours.

                        <h2> 3D Model & Assembly</h2>
                            <h5> Inspo </h5>
                                <img class="fit" src="images/week2/bottle.jpg" alt="Bottle">
                                <p>
                                    The second half of our project this week was to create a 3D model in Fusion 360. I had some previous experience with CAD software so I felt comfortable working with the Sketch features in Fusion 360. I wanted to create components that had some interesting geometries. I chose to model the bottle of IPA that we had lying around in the Makerspace.
                                </p>
                            <h5> Bottle body </h5>
                                <p>
                                    Initally, I thought to start with a cyclinder and cut out the corners and top sleeve out of the object later.</p>
                                <img class="fit" src="images/week2/fusion0.png">
                                <p>
                                    However I quickly found that the tools available in Fusion 360 made it easier to start with the side profile of the bottle first. So I started over with the measurements along the side of the bottle and sketched out a half-profile. </p>
                                <img class="fit" src="images/week2/fusion1.png">
                                    <p>Using <b>Revolve</b>, the side-profile created a solid object, but my bottle was hollow. So I used the <b>Shell</b> tool and measured the thickness of my bottle's walls to set the inner measurement. I was surprised that the Shell tool was able to follow the contour of the sketch I had made to create an even thickness throughout  the height of the object. I played around with the material of th object to ensure the inside of my bottle looked the way I wanted. </p>
                                <img class="fit" src="images/week2/fusion2.png">
                                    <p>Next, I needed to create the threading at the neck of the bottle. I tried using the <b>Thread</b> tool with a number of different settings, but I could not get it to replicate the threading I saw on the original bottle. Specifically, the Thread tool cut into the thickness of the object I had created, which makes sense if I was fabricating a screw, but I needed the threading to add onto the existing object.</p>
                                        
                                <img class="fit" src="images/week2/fusion3.png">
                                    <p>After some Googling, I found that the <b>Coil </b>tool produced a shape I was after. I created the coil as a separate object and then used <b>Split Body</b> to separate the coil into an inner and outer half. I discarded the inner half and used <b>Combine</b> to join the outer half of the coil to the main body.</p>
                            <h5> Cap and Spout </h5>
                                <img class="fit" src="images/week2/fusion7.png">
                                <p> The cap began as a simple stout cylinder, created by <b>Extruding</b> a circle. Again, I used <b>Shell</b> to hollow out the inside of the cap.
                                </p>
                                <img class="fit" src="images/week2/fusion8.png">
                                <p>The cap featured what I will call a "ridging" effect along its perimeter. I replicated this shape in my model by first creating a rectangular divot with <b>Emboss</b> and <b>Chamfer</b> onto the side of the cap and then using <b>Circular Pattern</b> to stamp it all around the edge. </p>
                                <img class="fit" src="images/week2/fusion4.png">
                                <img class="fit" src="images/week2/fusion5.png">
                                <p>Next, I had to create the irregularly shaped spout. I watched a tutorial on how to use the <b>Sweep</b> tool which I found worked very well for this application. I created a path that followed the bend of the spout on the original bottle then I measured the base diameter to use as the sweep profile.</p>
                            <h5> Assembly </h5>    
                                <img class="fit" src="images/week2/assembly.gif">
        <p> The assembly of the two components was straightforward. Given that the cap needed to twist on, I used a <b>Join</b> with Revolute motion, producing the final result shown above. Now I can wipe down my digital 3D printer beds with IPA!
                                </p>
