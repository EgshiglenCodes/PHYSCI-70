						<h5> The Inspiration </h5>

							<p>
								This week, I went out to eat at a Tibetan restaurant, where they had a beautiful tapestry depicting a Buddhist god with many arms.
								Knowing that for this week's assignment, I had to create a press-fit construction kit that can be assembled in multiple ways, I thought
								the many arms would make for a beautiful design.
							</p>
							<img class="fit" src="/Users/egshiglen/Documents/GitHub/PHYSCI-70/images/week2/process.png" alt="Process">
							<p>
								After scrolling through many images of various Buddhist gods and idols, I picked one image to use as a reference for my model.
								I cleaned up the image in Photoshop and then exported the .png to Fusion360 to use as a reference as I drew out the sketch of the main body.
							</p>
						<h5> The Sketch </h5>

							<p>
								Before I proceeded with creating the various parts of the press-fit construction, I sketched out the ways I would transfer a 2D image
								to a freestanding 3D construction. I was concerned with how I would ensure the model would stay upright and how I would connect the arms to main body.
								For simplicity, I decided I would create cross-hair feet to keep the model upright and create a 'spine' running behind the model to attach the arms.
							</p>
							<img class="fit" src="/Users/egshiglen/Documents/GitHub/PHYSCI-70/images/week2/fusion.png" alt="Fusion">
							<p>
								Actually sketching the press-fit shapes in Fusion3D was the most time intensive step of the process, but only because the design is mainly non-linear
								shapes. I made simplifications on smaller details for time. The final Fusion3D sketch included designs for the front-facing torso, arm, spine, and feet.
								The shape for the arms were replicated later in Lightburn.
							</br>
							</br>
								The width of 'notches' that would be used to press the shapes together depends on the thickness of the stock and the laser kerf. I wanted a tight fit between my
								pieces so I standardized my notch widths to 4.2mm.  
							</p>
						<h5> The Cut & Assembly </h5>
							<img class="fit" src="/Users/egshiglen/Documents/GitHub/PHYSCI-70/images/week2/cut.gif" alt="Lasercut">
							<p>
								The design was cut onto 4.5mm cardboard stock. I used the recommended laser setting which was 15mm/s speed and 60% strength, which cut clean through the cardboard.
							</p>
							<img class="fit" src="/Users/egshiglen/Documents/GitHub/PHYSCI-70/images/week2/views.png" alt="Views">
							<p>
								As shown above, the model can be constructed to customize the direction of the arms and torso. The 4 unattached arms can be fitted facing up or down, and the
								torso can lean left or right depending on how the pieces are assembled.
							</p>
						<h5> The Final Product </h5>
							<img class="fit" src="/Users/egshiglen/Documents/GitHub/PHYSCI-70/images/week2/final.png" alt="Final">
							<p>
								I am very happy with the final result. My small press-fit idol now sits happily on my windowsill to bless all my future fabrication endevours.
